    <h2>HOW TO ACHIEVE IT</h2>
    
    <p><b>1.Energy Efficiency</b></p>
        <p>-For Example:More than 50% of the energy produced in the United States is wasted somewhere along the line, from production and distribution to consumption.Our goal is to maximize economy-wide investment in energy efficiency. Focus areas include energy use in communities and the industrial sector.</p>
    
    <p><b>2.Energy Infrastructure</b></p>
    
        <img src="images/powerlines.jpg">    
    
        <p>-Many parts of the electric grid are antiquated, our oil dependence makes us vulnerable to price shocks; and our network of transmission lines is not robust enough to fully tap our renewable energy potential.</p>
        <p>-We need to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure so that it can accommodate the transition to renewable and low-carbon energy.</p>
        <p>-The current areas of focus include:</p>
        <p>*Fostering a coordinated build-out of alternative refueling stations among states and public-private interests.</p>
        <p>*Ensuring that needed transmission lines get built to unleash the Midwest’s vast clean energy potential.</p>
        <p>*Improving the knowledge base for how several technologies taken together can reduce the need for coal-fired power plants and support much higher reliance on renewable energy new transmission, energy efficiency, demand response, energy storage, selected smart grid technologies and distributed generation.</p>
    <p><b>3.Fossil Energy</b></p>
    
        <img src="images/solarpanel.jpg">
    
        <p>-Globally, the world’s population relies on fossil fuels for over 80 percent of our energy, and the use of coal, oil and natural gas continues to grow dramatically.</p>
        <p>-Continued fossil energy abundance brings important and welcome economic and energy security benefits. It also presents profound challenges to reducing the carbon and environmental footprint of our future energy system.</p>
        <p>-Policies and technologies have been put up to ensure that future production and use of fossil fuels result in ever lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.</p>
    
    <p><b>4.International Collaboration</b></p>
        <p>-International collaborations provide a unique opportunity to exchange ideas on critical energy and climate issues, build key relationships, and advance innovation between international governments,companies, and organizations.</p>
    
    <p><b>5.Renewable Energy</b></p>
            
        <img src="images/windturbines.jpg">
        
        <p>-Our vision is an energy system that relies heavily on renewable sources of electricity and fuels to meet our needs for electricity, heating, cooling and transportation.</p>
        <p>-Areas of focus on renewable fuels include:</p>
        <p>*Growing the nation’s renewable biogas and biomethane industry.</p>
        <p>*Turning abundant organic “wastes” into renewable energy.</p>
        <p>*Supporting the commercialization and scale-up of next-gen biofuels (from non-food sources).</p>
        <p>*Promoting bioproducts and chemicals as a growth strategy for modern biorefineries.</p>
        
    <p><b>6.Sustainable Communities</b></p>
        <p>-Cities and communities are critical to mitigating climate change because collectively they are big enough to matter and small enough to make changes quickly.</p>
        <p>-The programs that can be put up to assist communities in different way with all elements to drive change include:</p>
        <p>*Co-directing a 'GreenStep City Program' with the Pollution Control Agency,which encourages and assists local governments in adopting proven sustainable development policies and practices.</p>
        <p>*Supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Metropolitan city areas.</p>
        <p>*Provide sustainability and resiliency planning and technical assistance.</p>
    
    <p><b>7.Transportation</b></p>
         
        <img src="images/electrictrain.jpg">
    
        <p>-Our goals are to accelerate the commercial deployment of domestic, low- and zero-carbon transportation fuels, improve vehicle efficiency and promote better urban development as a source of competitive advantage for companies and cities. Current priorities Include:</p>
        <p>*Reducing the “carbon intensity” and environmental performance of conventional biofuels.</p>
        <p>*Commercialization of next-gen biofuels, including biogas.</p>
        <p>*Fostering a coherent refueling network for advanced domestic fuels such as electricity, biofuels, biogas, natural gas, and hydrogen.</p>
